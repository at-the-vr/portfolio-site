# My Blog

- this needs linting + extensions for astro + tw

- building blog -> moving it to just be part of portfolio site

## portfolio-site migration

- check out the astro tools
  - audit
- framer motion + animations stuff doesn't work rn
  - some might make sense to just convert to js? ie typewriter
- page titles + metadata
- font blurry?
- smooth animation for same page links
- contact spacing wonky
