Towards the end of The Creative Act I was reading it to finish it not because I enjoyed it. The book offers some interesting insights, but I think ultimately it just wasn't for me. There where certainty some sections I found valuable but overall the book never really drew my in. Rick Rubin seems like a super interesting guy and obviously is incredibly successful in his field but I don't think he is a great writer yet.
