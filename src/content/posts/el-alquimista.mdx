This was the first book I have read in Spanish and I'm really glad I choose it. I read it in about 10 days, around the same time I visited San Juan, Puerto Rico and the two really coincided perfectly. I was looking at reviews on Goodreads before I read this and I think some of the negative reviews were very telling. I understand why it could be interpreted as a self-help book, but I think if that is your takeaway from it then that's probably a bigger reflection of you than the book itself.
