### Comprehendible input

Inspired by [Stephen Krashen](https://www.sdkrashen.com/) and his theory of [comprehensible input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUc_W3xE1w) I decided to begin reading books in Spanish. Spoiler alert: I've been loving it and have already seen significant improvements in my Spanish abilities. 

As I write this I'm almost done with my second book and am enjoying reading more than I have since elementary school. My Spanish is intermediate: I can get my point across but I always feel like my vocabulary is holding me back. I've tried using tradional learning methods, but have always found them to be boring and not very effective. The one resource I've found effective and enjoyable is [Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/) and I highly recommend it to beginners, but it only lays out a foundation and it's up to you to build on it.

### The perfect book for an intermediate Spanish learner

El Alquimista (The Alchemist in English) was a perfect intermediate choice. The "chapters" are super short, the language is relatively simple, and the story is engaging. I think the fact that it is a translation (Portugese to Spanish) was helpful, as it made the language more accessible. As I read [Cien AÃ±os de Soledad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude) (One Hundred Years of Solitude) I find the language to be considerably more difficult and I would attribute a lot of this to fact that it was originally written in Spanish.

O Alquimista, written by [Paulo Coelho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Coelho) and originally published in Brazil in 1988, follows the journey of Santiago, a young Andalusian shepherd who dreams of finding a treasure in the pyramids of Egypt. It engages in themes of destiny and the importance of listening to ones heart. As is typical of South American literature, it employs magical realism to infuse an otherwise straightforward story with a sense of wonder and possibility. 

### Self-help or literature

Upon completing El Alquimista I went to the books [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/18144590) and was quite surprised to see many reviewers criticize it for being a self-help book masquerading as literature. While I understand why it could be interpreted this way, I think it's a bit unfair and likely a bigger reflection on the reader than the book itself. 

In the foreword Coelho writes of his own experience with alchemy, which is crazy I don't want to endorse that by any means, however ...
